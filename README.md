README for Mastermind Game

Overview
This repository contains the source code for a Mastermind game implementation. Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game played between two players. This version is designed to be played on a computer, where the player competes against the machine.

Features
Single-Player Gameplay: Play against the computer in a challenging code-breaking game.
Graphical User Interface: The game is built using Turtle Graphics, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.
Object-Oriented Programming: The game is developed using OOP principles, making the code organized and modular.
Persistent Leaderboard: Scores are tracked and saved, allowing players to view their progress over time.
Randomized Codes: Each game round features a new code generated by the computer, ensuring a unique challenge every time.
Win/Lose States: Clear indications of victory or defeat in each round with animations.

Tech Stack
Python: The primary programming language used.
Turtle Graphics: A Python library for creating graphics and providing a GUI.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Used for structuring the game's code.

How to Play
Start the Game: Run the Python script to start the game.
Guess the Code: The computer generates a secret code, and the player makes guesses to crack it.
Feedback: After each guess, the player receives feedback to help refine future guesses.
Winning: The game is won by guessing the correct code within a given number of attempts.

Installation
To play the game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from python.org.
